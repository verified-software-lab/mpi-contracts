/* This is a SARL configuration file.
 * It contains one entry for each theorem prover SARL may use.
 * To resolve a query, by default, SARL will use the first prover here.
 * If that result in inconclusive, it will try the second prover.
 * And so on, until a conclusive result has been reached, or all provers
 * have been exhausted.
 * 
 * SARL looks for a configuration file by looking in the following
 * places in order:
 * 1. .sarl in current working directory
 * 2. .sarl in user's home directory
 * 3. .sarl_default in current working directory
 * 4. .sarl_default in user's home directory
