 * array of strings: each entry is a "chunk" of the file; the
 * file may be viewed as a concatenation of those chunks.
 *
 * A "point" in the file is represented by an ordered pair
 * of integers (chunkIndex, characterIndex).
 *
 * The flags all have int type instead of boolean because
 * CVC3 does not support tuples with boolean components.
 * Zero is used for false, one for true.
 * A file is an output file if it is ever written to.
 * A file is an input file if it is ever read before being written to.
 * A file can be both an input and an output file.
 * A file is either a binary or text file.  The kind is determined
 * by how the file is opened.
 * A file is either an ordinary character file or a wide character
 * file.  The orientation is determined by the first access to the
 * file.
