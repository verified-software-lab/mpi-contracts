/**
 * A StateManagerIF provides part of a generic interface to a state-transition
 * system. The primary method is {@link #nextState}, which, given a state and a
 * transition, returns the "next state", i.e., the state which results from
 * executing the transition from the given state. Other methods are provided
 * that are needed specifically for depth-first search, including methods to
 * mark a state as "seen before", and to make a state as "currently on (or off)
 * the stack". Still other methods are provided for printing information abou
 * states.
